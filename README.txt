## Overview

You are a cat. 
In the large world around you, exploration seems to have no bounds. You see from the catâ€™s point of view, hear what a cat can hear, and live like a cat lives...almost. 
The one main difference between you and the rest of the cats of the planet is that you are employed as a private investigator. As Cat PI, you search for clues that might help uncover the cause of a mysterious death. 
The deceased in question happens to be the owner of some feline acquaintances. You have taken it upon yourself to solve this mystery and bring closure to the newly orphaned pets.
